# Lean-first-steps
I started learning Lean in order to write fully-formal proofs. I will put some of my early attempts into this repository. I will be happy for any feedback!

- Limits of sequences (very basic properties): `Sequences_limits.lean`
- Complete induction (from standard induction): `Complete_induction.lean`
- Cantor's theorem (with detailed explanation): `Cantor_explained.lean`
