# Lean-first-steps
I started learning Lean in order to write fully-formal proofs. I will put some of my early attempts into this repository. I will be happy for any feedback!

- [Limits of sequences](src/Sequences_limits.lean) (very basic properties)
- [Complete induction](src/Complete_induction.lean) (from standard induction)
- [Cantor's theorem](src/Cantor_explained.lean) (with detailed explanation)
